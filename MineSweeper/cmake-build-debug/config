x = 8
y = 8
d = 10

Board(x, y) represents the dimensions of the board you will play on.

I recommend having a difficulty level smaller than x * y,
otherwise, it may take a long time to load your game board, or it might result in an error.
The difficulty level, the smaller it is, the harder the game.
